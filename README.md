# Secure-University-Student-Course-Registration-System

Here is brief information about project:
The Term Project concerns University Student Course Registration System actors of which are students (S), academic advisors (AA), (vice-) chairs VC, deans (D), rectors (R), and system administrator (SA).  S can see his own record and view and select courses for his/her program meeting prerequisite requirements. Student’s normal load is 3-5 courses. Graduating student can have up to 7 courses. Student has assigned to him/her AA. AA can see records of assigned to him/her students. AA can do operations allowed to S but can also confirm student’s courses. VC can view all departmental students’ records and can do what AA doing. VC can assign S to AA and insert/delete/update departmental course information. D can view students’ records of all the departments from his/her faculty. D cannot confirm students’ programs. R can view all university students’ records. R cannot confirm students’ programs. SA gives users roles of VC, D, and R. Data are kept DES-encrypted. Secret key is supported and updated periodically by SA.
